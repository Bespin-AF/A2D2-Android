\n\n2. If you find yourself with no safe alternative, simply press the “Request Driver” button. The app will use your current GPS location and you will receive a notification when a driver is dispatched.
\n\n3. A2D2 drivers will only transport you to your home address. If you are making a request on behalf of a group, the driver is only required to take the group to a single address. If members of the group need to go to multiple homes, those individuals will need to make separate pickup requests.</string>
