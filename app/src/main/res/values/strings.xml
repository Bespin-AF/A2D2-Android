Use of this program should be your last resort, not your Plan A.\n\n2. If you find yourself with no safe alternative, simply press the “Request Driver” button. The app will use your current GPS location and you will receive a notification when a driver is dispatched.\n\n3. A2D2 drivers will only transport you to your home address. If you are making a request on behalf of a group, the driver is only required to take the group to a single address. If members of the group need to go to multiple homes, those individuals will need to make separate pickup requests.</string>
